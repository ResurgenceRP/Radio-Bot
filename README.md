# RADIO BOT FOR ROLEPLAY SERVERS

## Introduction

This Discord bot is specifically designed for DayZ Roleplay (RP) communities, aiming to enhance the immersive experience within Discord servers dedicated to role-playing within the DayZ universe. It facilitates role-play by handling in-character radio communications and automating message management to maintain a clean and focused role-play environment.

## Features

- **In-Character Radio Communication:**
  - Captures messages sent to a designated channel (the in-game radio channel) and reposts them embedded in a format simulating radio communication, enhancing role-play immersion.

- **Administration Log:**
  - Each radio message is reposted to an admin-specific channel with detailed metadata, including the author's Discord tag and ID. This feature aids administrators in monitoring in-character communication for moderation.

- **Automated Message Deletion:**
  - Reposted radio messages are automatically deleted after 24 hours (configurable). This ensures that the channel remains clutter-free and focused on relevant role-play communication.

- **Scheduled Cleanup:**
  - Uses a periodic (each 30 seconds) cleanup task to handle expired messages efficiently, ensuring performance and scalability.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Get Your Bot Token**
   - Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Log in with your Discord account.
   - Click the "New Application" button at the top-right.
   - Enter a name for your bot (e.g., "Radio Bot") and click "Create."
   - In the application's settings menu on the left, select the **Bot** tab and click "Add Bot."
   - Confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!"
   - Under the **Bot** tab, scroll down to "Token" and click the "Copy" button to copy your bot token.
   - While in the **Bot** tab, enable the following intents: **Presence Intent**, **Server Members Intent**, **Message Content Intent**
   > [!CAUTION]
   > Keep your token secret! Do not share it publicly.

### 2. **Get Your Channel IDs**
   - Open your Discord application.
   - Enable Developer Mode:
     - Go to **User Settings** (click the gear icon in the bottom-left).
     - Under **Advanced**, toggle on **Developer Mode**.
   - Right-click on the desired channel and select **Copy ID**:
     - **Radio Channel ID:** Right-click the channel where users will send in-character radio messages.
     - **Admin Channel ID:** Right-click the channel where administrative logs will be sent.
   - Paste the copied IDs into a text file for safekeeping.

### 3. **Install Python and Required Libraries**
   - Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -U discord.py aiomysql pydantic PyYAML
     ```

### 4. **Configure the Bot**
   - Edit `config.yaml` file in the same directory as the script with the following structure:
     ```yaml
        TOKEN: "TOKEN"                                          # Discord bot token, string
        CHANNEL_ID: 1307016491677519943                         # Channel ID for bot to listen in, integer
        ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID: 1307016506739130400                   # Channel ID of channel for administrator login (Player name, Message, no autodeletion), integer
        STAFF_ROLE_ID: 1307026532895817829                      # Role ID of staff member group to ping on critical errors, integer
        FOOTER_PUBLIC: "Embeed Footer for Public Reposts."      # Footer used in public channels, should not be empty | String
        FOOTER_ADMIN: "Message Footer used in Admin channels"   # Footer used in Admin Channel, should not be empty | String

        # OPTIONAL !!!! Change flatfile storage to SQL based database:
        USE_DATABASE: false                                     # Change to "true" to enable Database Storage, set to "false" to switch to flatfile storage. Default value: false, Boolean
        DATABASE:
          HOST: "localhost"                                     # Location of database server, string
          PORT: 3306                                            # Port database is listening on, integer
          USER: "USERNAME"                                      # username in database with access to database defined in DATABASE_NAME, string
          PASSWORD: "PASSWORD"                                  # Password to USER account, string
          DATABASE_NAME: "DATABASE_NAME"                        # Database name, default: RADIO_BOT, string
     ``` 
   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > If you decide to use database storage, it is important to create a new dedicated database user for the bot following your flavor of database instructions. Avoid using admin accounts with broad access ranges for security reasons. If you are unsure which is a better choice for you, flatfile storage is a safer bet albeit might be slower on servers with a lot of messages being sent.

### 5. **Run the Bot**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script and `config.yaml`.
   - Start the bot:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - Alternatively, set up the bot as a service [Linux]:
     ```ini
     [Unit]
     Description=Radio Bot Service

     [Service]
     ExecStart=python3 main.py
     WorkingDirectory=/path/to/script
     Restart=always

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```
   > [!TIP]  
   > Setting the bot to run as a service will allow it to automatically start after a crash or server reboot.

### 6. **MySQL Database Setup**
   - If using a database, ensure MySQL is running and accessible.
   - The bot will automatically create the required `deletion_schedule` table if it doesnâ€™t exist.

### 7. **Bot Permissions**
   - Make sure your bot has the following permissions in appropriate channels:
     - Read Messages
     - Send Messages
     - Manage Messages
     - Embed Links

## Usage

Once set up, the bot will automatically:
- Handle messages sent to the designated radio channel.
- Repost messages in an immersive, in-character radio format.
- Log messages in the admin channel for moderation purposes.
- Delete reposted messages after the specified duration (default: 24 hours).
- Notify administrators in case of critical errors (e.g., database failures).
- Shutdown gracefully when a critical error is encountered.

### Example Configuration Validation Errors
If your `config.yaml` file is missing required keys or has invalid types, the bot will display detailed validation errors to help you fix the configuration.

## Advanced Features

- **Periodic Cleanup:**
  - The bot uses a periodic task to delete expired messages efficiently, ensuring smooth operation even under high usage.

- **Retry Mechanisms:**
  - Automatically retries Discord API calls when encountering rate limits or transient errors.
